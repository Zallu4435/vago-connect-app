./src/components/Chat/MediaGallery/MediaPreviewGridItem.jsx
26:9  Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image` or a custom image loader to automatically optimize images. This may incur additional usage or cost from your provider. See: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/no-img-element  @next/next/no-img-element

./src/components/Chat/messages/DocumentMessage.jsx
29:9  Warning: The 'messages' logical expression could make the dependencies of useMemo Hook (at line 48) change on every render. Move it inside the useMemo callback. Alternatively, wrap the initialization of 'messages' in its own useMemo() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./src/components/Chat/messages/ImageMessage.jsx

./src/components/common/CapturePhoto.jsx
43:18  Warning: The ref value 'videoRef.current' will likely have changed by the time this effect cleanup function runs. If this ref points to a node rendered by React, copy 'videoRef.current' to a variable inside the effect, and use that variable in the cleanup function.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

49:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'socket'. Either include it or remove the dependency array. Mutable values like 'socket.current' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
